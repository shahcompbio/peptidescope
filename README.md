# PeptideScope

> ðŸ”¬ **PeptideScope** is a Nextflow pipeline for visualizing peptides on transcript structures, highlighting their relationship to splice variants, isoforms, and genomic context.

## Overview

PeptideScope visualizes detected MS peptides in the context of transcriptomic data. Currently only compatible with CDS predictions from transdecoder and peptides detected with Fragpipe

## Features

- Visualization of peptides on transcript structures
